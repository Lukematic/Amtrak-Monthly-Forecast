# <Forecasting Amtrak Ridership Using Time Series>
## Description
Using Amtrak data from January 1991 to  May 2013 our goal was to forecast the number of passengers for the months of June, July, and August 2013. The predictions would help Amtrak plan better as they were replacing models, maintaining rail lines, and other necessary maintenance. In this project, we used several time series models to build the forecast. On an interesting note, on this project, we had a biased Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF)test.
